## Documentation

Refer to the [Developer Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to get an idea how the app was structured, and how to build and package the app.

## Contributing

All work done on the Chartr app happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/Chartr.Android). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

If you are interested in contributing directly to the code base, the first thing you should do is read our [Litepaper](https://github.com/AerovekCommunity/litepaper) to get an understanding of what Chartr is and how it's supposed to work. 

## Downloading the beta version
The beta version is useful in case you are not a developer and would like to contribute by playing with the app and proposing new features or reporting bugs that you find. 
Keep in mind that it is not going to be the latest version. If you'd like to request a new beta build, please create a issue ticket for that.

You can download the current beta version by opening this link from your Android device
